Emacs Hashapass
===============

This is an elisp version of the algorithm described at http://www.hashapass.com
for generating passwords from a token and master password.

Usage
-----

;; In your .emacs, make sure whereever you put the libs is in your load path:
(setq load-path (cons "/path/to/hashapass" load-path))

;; Load hashapass
(require 'hashapass)

;; Use it
;; M-x insert-hashapass

;; Bind it
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") 'insert-hashapass)

Misc
----

You can use this in other code by using the non-interactive base function:

(hashapass token password)

Utility, interactive functions are defined for inserting into the main buffer
and displaying the generated password in the minibuf:

(insert-hashapas token password) ;; Insert into current buffer
(show-hashapass token password)  ;; Show in minibuffer

Ideas
-----

- Make the master password encrypted somehere to avoid having to type it
  everytime.
